<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The second manifestation of the project happens through the work of Juan Crespo. The artist’s web based ongoing practice focuses on aspects linked to historiographical interpretation from an interdisciplinary and new media perspective. This exhibition presents a physical form of THE DIASPORA OF THE LINE, a digital fictional archive created with files from the Imperial War Museum, British Empire and Commonwealth Museum. By using film stills and geometrical shapes Juan tends to destroy and fragment the sequential interpretation of the Colonialist process and overturn predetermined historical meanings.</p>

<p>Juan Crespo (b. 1987, Zaragoza) lives and works in London. He graduated in Fine Arts from the University of Barcelona, where he also studied the MA in Artistic Production and Research. He has recently shown works in Barcelona (Sala d’Art Jove, ARSM or Loop Video Art Festival), Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Santander, “Biennal Leandre Cristófol” La Panera, Lleida and Festival Cine-Septiembre, Sinaloa, México. He is Co-Founder of PIL Project, presented at London Metropolitan University, and now part of the Digital Artist Residency within the Wrong Biennale. PIL Project has recently been granted in Step Beyond to develop a research project in the Russia’s new internet content law.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vinyl 03]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-03/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60bc378d-6351-4d5c-b9df-64d5f0b6772c</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/tumblr_nz3s7ihyKf1umkksno1_1280.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vinyl 02]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-02/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cd6e84e5-c99e-4ded-970a-a328c1bbbb06</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/vinyl-02.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vinyl 01]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-01/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50f43c38-fd40-43e4-87d5-59d5e2725c1d</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/vinyl-01.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Archive: from the retrospective to the generative]]></title><description><![CDATA[&#35;1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones

<p><em>The hypothesis – that the archive as artwork challenges the notion of history as a discourse based primarily upon chronology and documentation – no longer presupposes a stable and retroactive archive, but often a generative one.</em>
<strong>[1]</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, an archive is seen as a physical collection of documents, chronologically organized. These documents are mostly originals and have a historical, cultural or evidential factor, constituting what we perceive as ‘facts’. It only exists in relation to a space, as that is the physical manifestation of this entity – the arkheion <strong>[2]</strong>. With the evolution of media and the dissemination of information - culminating perhaps with the Internet – the traditional understanding of the archive, its components and the space that inhabits started changing significantly and used as means and medium for artistic practice. For the purposes of this essay it is significant to try and understand, not only what can be the status of an archive and of its contents, but also – and maybe more importantly – how can these contents’ authority changes in relation to its subjects. How do these systems of relations with the ‘so called’ factual information are manifested and subverted through the artistic practice? For that matter there is an analysis of Georgia Spickett-Jones’ work in order to better unpack these questions.</p>

<p>In the contemporary art field the adjective <em>ongoing</em> is often associated to artistic and curatorial practices focused on the unfolding and development of artistic and curatorial long-term projects, more than to a finite work of art or exhibition. Furthermore, ongoing practices - both curatorial and artistic – are, most of the time, mentioned in relation to the term <em>project</em>. This recurring connection reinforces the nature of ongoing practices and unveils the intrinsic characteristics they share with what, in art, is identified with the term project.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the discourse around ongoing approaches to artistic and curatorial projects is relevant more than ever and, at the same time - in the two last decades – archival art obtained a central role in the art scene, becoming a widely shared artistic practice among visual artists. It is relevant for our discourse to look specifically at artists working on archival projects using an ongoing artistic approach. It is worth to investigate how in the contemporary art world ongoing artistic practices are often associated with archival projects that are developed and presented by artists over a long period of time, sometimes as open-ended and ever-present project in their artistic career.</p>

<p>There is no better way to highlight these peculiar ever-present aspects in archival projects than by looking at famous archival projects by well-known artists that combined archival art and ongoing artistic practice. In this case I focused on Boltanski’s <em>The Heart Archive</em>, <em>Deller and Kane’s Folk Archive</em>, and <em>The Atlas Group Archive by</em> Lebanese artist Walid Raad.</p>

<p><em>“You will be working in that space for the next eight months”</em> is what our tutor told us not more than one month ago regarding our MA’s final curatorial project. Despite our experience and knowledge of curating is still in its initial stages of development, since the beginning we felt the huge responsibility of “taking care” of such a challenging situation in terms of timing and contents. We felt really privileged in having the freedom of expressing and materialising our curatorial ideas, doubts and concerns within such an interesting and empowering space as the Window on Whithechapel High Street. Since the beginning, we also felt the urge of tracing a sort of thematic and conceptual thread throughout the eight-months programme of exhibitions, as a valid way to communicate our curatorial desires both within the city environment and the MA course we were about to complete.</p>

<p>But where to find a point of departure? How to construct such a detailed curatorial plan able to survive throughout the eight months? How to create an expanded narrative able to support the multiplicity of interests we wanted to explore? How to “cure” such a complicated patient? We were stuck in the attempt of taking control of this complex mechanism and we were not brave enough to let it go towards improvisation and uncontrolled state. We wanted to reach that safe place where all the interactions, connections and clashes related to the “curatorial” would have been directed by us, according to our will and taste. But it was not possible to realise. Not in such a short time. Not for such a long time.</p>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The first manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Georgia Spickett-Jones. Her ongoing practice deals with questions of the fictionalisation of archival material and identity politics. Combining personal stories with cultural histories, Georgia focuses on display as a mediator of  those relationships that exist between subject, object and the viewer. This exhibition is yet another extension of IS IT ARROGANT TO USE HIS HAT?, displayed previously in June 2015 at Wimbledon College of Art, now inhabiting the window to further develop. </p>

<p>Georgia Spickett-Jones (b. 1992, Bristol) uses multiple forms and reflexive methods to consider the limitations of an archival art practice. IS IT ARROGANT TO USE HIS HAT? (2015) is an on-going project using personal artefacts, pseudo-science and curatorial hierarchies to uncover the author as both subject and object. She holds a BA (Hons) Fine Art: Print and Time-based Media at Wimbledon College of Art (2013-2015).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Window Space Image]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/window-space-image/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4605e6e5-7cb9-4863-a483-aafe66324971</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/windowspaceimage.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item></channel></rss>
