<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The fourth  manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Lauren Goldie. </p>

<p>As a process based artist, Lauren is interested in the recording of the ritualistic and evolutionary nature of an artistic practice and in exploring methods of archiving and documenting the effect of light in space. Her latest body of work is influenced by her experimentations with wax, its variations and the concept of regeneration. She often deconstructs and works upon older pieces in order to create new ones. At the Window Space Lauren will revisit her work Time3 and the photography she has archived during her active installations. She will be attempting to interpret a 3-D map detailing the circulation of light and its transformation within an environment.</p>

<p>Lauren Goldie (b. 1993) is a British installation Artist based in Cambridge. She recently completed her BA in Fine Art with First class Hons, specialising in installation and printmaking at Winchester School of Art. During her studies, she developed a disciplined approach to making art with a focus on precisely executed artistic processes and thoroughly documented experiments with materials. As well as developing relationships within her local community at the Curwen Print Study Centre, Lauren has been recognised for awards such as Float Art 2015 and was rated within the top 50 Art graduates by the People of Print. As her work continues to develop, she has become increasingly interested in producing mixed media artworks that compliment her signature glass wax installations. Her work was recently featured in the RE: IMAGINED exhibition at the GX Gallery in London, where she volunteered her time as an Artist and Creative Assistant to raise funds and awareness for Parkinson's UK.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#3.1 Inês Marques]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>4 February 2016 <br>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The third manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Inês Marques. Her practice is focused on language, culture and craft and how globalisation and new media have an impact in these social aspects. Blend In is her new individual design project, which is going to have its first public debut at the Window Space. The artist assumes a critical point of view over political and economical issues worldwide, which affect how nations are seen though their economical potential. It functions as a study on how economical interests can overlap political values – ‘going to bed with the enemy’ for the sake of money – and as a critique of the homogenisation of the nations through globalisation, making these lose their traditions and authenticity. </p>

<p>Inês Marques (b. 1990, Lisbon) is a London based designer. She has completed a BA in Multimedia Arts - Installation and Performance at the Fine Arts University of Lisbon, Portugal and is currently undertaking an MA Material Futures at Central Saint Martins – University Arts of London, aimed at engaging designers to have a critical and social point of view whilst developing their projects. She was involved in the MAE’ Artist Residents in Sesimbra and worked in collaboration with FAZ – a young collective group at Arpad Szenes and Vieira da Silva Museum, Lisbon. Her work has recently been shown at PROTECHT exhibition at The Cass Bank Gallery and undertook the role of tutor/designer in Concept Catwalk, a project in collaboration with V&amp;A, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and fashion designer Nicky Vu for students of Prendergast Hilly Fields College.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot - Right Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot-right-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3c56b0e0-0de0-42cb-ae6e-6703276bbf96</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 12:08:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot---Right-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot - Left Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot-left-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3bf0a00b-81f4-4541-aca0-a08f39968c16</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot---Left-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">efe82446-83ab-4f7c-ac83-1e7ea6a0a05d</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 12:04:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Curator with a K]]></title><description><![CDATA[2015

<p>This essay intends to explore how the role of the curator is expanding and adapting to the current new media based world, with a specific focus on web platforms. It analyses curatorial practice with and within the internet realm, ultimately posing questions related to spatial hierarchies and to the curator’s role within them.</p>

<p>Primarily, it is important to define and relate the concepts of immateriality and systems; those being the ones that define the ‘what, where and how’ of web-based art and, consequently, its curatorial challenges. There is a need to understand these new emerging ‘materialities’ as well as analysing how they work in this network system basis they inhabit. With this, there is a clearer understanding of how the role of the curator is shifting more towards a system-based collaboration, instead of the centralized model of working – the curator as a gatekeeper <strong>[1]</strong>.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ideas propositioned before, there are presented two distinct yet related examples of web influenced curatorial modes. The first is Unoriginal Genius, an exhibition curated by Domenico Quaranta at Carroll/Fletcher’s Project Space in 2014, comprising a series of web and screen based works that had a physical presence on the physical space.  It is important to stress how the curator deals with web-based works inside a gallery space and furthermore, how the institution deals with the rapidly expanding web presence, in terms of defining values and discourses. Following that, Kurator, a project developed by the programmer Grzesiek Sedek and the curator Joasia Krysa in 2004, is presented as an example of a web based software aided curating system. It depicts how art lives outside the gallery and it highlights questions of collaboration within open source networks, particularly related to curating.</p>

<p>The internet’s interface introduces exciting new opportunities and possibilities, though the concern might not be just questions of display, but to consider how both physical and web-based spaces relate and co-exist and, ultimately, how these emerging systems have influenced the practice of both artists and curators.</p>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The second manifestation of the project happens through the work of Juan Crespo. The artist’s web based ongoing practice focuses on aspects linked to historiographical interpretation from an interdisciplinary and new media perspective. This exhibition presents a physical form of THE DIASPORA OF THE LINE, a digital fictional archive created with files from the Imperial War Museum, British Empire and Commonwealth Museum. By using film stills and geometrical shapes Juan tends to destroy and fragment the sequential interpretation of the Colonialist process and overturn predetermined historical meanings.</p>

<p>Juan Crespo (b. 1987, Zaragoza) lives and works in London. He graduated in Fine Arts from the University of Barcelona, where he also studied the MA in Artistic Production and Research. He has recently shown works in Barcelona (Sala d’Art Jove, ARSM or Loop Video Art Festival), Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Santander, “Biennal Leandre Cristófol” La Panera, Lleida and Festival Cine-Septiembre, Sinaloa, México. He is Co-Founder of PIL Project, presented at London Metropolitan University, and now part of the Digital Artist Residency within the Wrong Biennale. PIL Project has recently been granted in Step Beyond to develop a research project in the Russia’s new internet content law.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones - Installation Shot - Right Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-02/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cd6e84e5-c99e-4ded-970a-a328c1bbbb06</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-1-1-Georgia-Spickett-Jones-Installation-Shot---Right-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones - Installation Shot - Left Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-03/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">60bc378d-6351-4d5c-b9df-64d5f0b6772c</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-1-1-Georgia-Spickett-Jones-Installation-Shot---Left-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones - Installation Shot]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-01/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">50f43c38-fd40-43e4-87d5-59d5e2725c1d</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/-1-1-Georgia-Spickett-Jones-Installation-Shot.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Archive: from the retrospective to the generative]]></title><description><![CDATA[&#35;1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones

<p><em>The hypothesis – that the archive as artwork challenges the notion of history as a discourse based primarily upon chronology and documentation – no longer presupposes a stable and retroactive archive, but often a generative one.</em>
<strong>[1]</strong></p>

<p>Traditionally, an archive is seen as a physical collection of documents, chronologically organized. These documents are mostly originals and have a historical, cultural or evidential factor, constituting what we perceive as ‘facts’. It only exists in relation to a space, as that is the physical manifestation of this entity – the arkheion <strong>[2]</strong>. With the evolution of media and the dissemination of information - culminating perhaps with the Internet – the traditional understanding of the archive, its components and the space that inhabits started changing significantly and used as means and medium for artistic practice. For the purposes of this essay it is significant to try and understand, not only what can be the status of an archive and of its contents, but also – and maybe more importantly – how can these contents’ authority changes in relation to its subjects. How do these systems of relations with the ‘so called’ factual information are manifested and subverted through the artistic practice? For that matter there is an analysis of Georgia Spickett-Jones’ work in order to better unpack these questions.</p>

<p>In the contemporary art field the adjective <em>ongoing</em> is often associated to artistic and curatorial practices focused on the unfolding and development of artistic and curatorial long-term projects, more than to a finite work of art or exhibition. Furthermore, ongoing practices - both curatorial and artistic – are, most of the time, mentioned in relation to the term <em>project</em>. This recurring connection reinforces the nature of ongoing practices and unveils the intrinsic characteristics they share with what, in art, is identified with the term project.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the discourse around ongoing approaches to artistic and curatorial projects is relevant more than ever and, at the same time - in the two last decades – archival art obtained a central role in the art scene, becoming a widely shared artistic practice among visual artists. It is relevant for our discourse to look specifically at artists working on archival projects using an ongoing artistic approach. It is worth to investigate how in the contemporary art world ongoing artistic practices are often associated with archival projects that are developed and presented by artists over a long period of time, sometimes as open-ended and ever-present project in their artistic career.</p>

<p>There is no better way to highlight these peculiar ever-present aspects in archival projects than by looking at famous archival projects by well-known artists that combined archival art and ongoing artistic practice. In this case I focused on Boltanski’s <em>The Heart Archive</em>, <em>Deller and Kane’s Folk Archive</em>, and <em>The Atlas Group Archive by</em> Lebanese artist Walid Raad.</p>

<p><em>“You will be working on that space for the next eight months”</em> is what our tutor, regarding our MA final curatorial project, has told us curators, not more than one month ago. Despite our experience and knowledge about curating still being in its initial stages of development, since the beginning we felt the huge responsibility of ‘taking care’ of such a challenging situation in terms of both time and contents. We felt privileged in having the freedom to express and materialise our curatorial ideas, doubts and concerns within such an interesting and empowering space as that Window on Whitechapel High Street. Since the beginning, we also felt the urge of tracing a sort of thematic and conceptual thread throughout the eight-months programme of exhibitions, as a valid way to communicate our curatorial desires within both the city environment and the MA course we were about to complete. </p>

<p>But where to find a point of departure? How to construct such a detailed curatorial plan able to survive throughout the eight months? How to create an expanded narrative able to support the multiplicity of interests we would have liked to explore? How to ‘cure’ such a complicated patient? We were missing the key factor of the ‘let’s do it’ whilst trying to figure everything out before starting. We were stuck in the attempt of taking control of this complex mechanism and we were not brave enough to let it go towards an improvisational and uncontrolled state. We wanted to reach that safe place where all the interactions, connections and clashes related to the ‘curatorial’  would have been directed by us, according to our will and taste. But this was not possible to realise. Not in such a short time. Not for such a long time.</p>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The first manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Georgia Spickett-Jones. Her ongoing practice deals with questions of the fictionalisation of archival material and identity politics. Combining personal stories with cultural histories, Georgia focuses on display as a mediator of  those relationships that exist between subject, object and the viewer. This exhibition is yet another extension of IS IT ARROGANT TO USE HIS HAT?, displayed previously in June 2015 at Wimbledon College of Art, now inhabiting the window to further develop. </p>

<p>Georgia Spickett-Jones (b. 1992, Bristol) uses multiple forms and reflexive methods to consider the limitations of an archival art practice. IS IT ARROGANT TO USE HIS HAT? (2015) is an on-going project using personal artefacts, pseudo-science and curatorial hierarchies to uncover the author as both subject and object. She holds a BA (Hons) Fine Art: Print and Time-based Media at Wimbledon College of Art (2013-2015).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Window Space - Whitechapel High Street]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/window-space-image/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">4605e6e5-7cb9-4863-a483-aafe66324971</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2015 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/01/windowspaceimage.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item></channel></rss>
