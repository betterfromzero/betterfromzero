<p>&#35;0.2 Workshop marks the middle point of IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO. It aims to be a point of discussion and exchange between curators and artists, touching upon relevant aspects of the project and its outlines. It intends to take stock of the project and its development, and to understand how questions of unpredictability, production, time, space and collaboration will have an impact of the continuation of the project and return of each artist to the Window Space, for a second display. This is a closed doors event held at the Whitechapel Gallery, London, streaming live from 2.30pm-5pm.</p>

<p>&#35;0.2 counts with the presence of Miriam LaRosa, co-curator of LIMITACTION, that ran from January to July 2015 at the Window Space. It was a collaborative project that developed in the form of an artistic residency with the artist Charlotte Warne Thomas, aiming to transform the Window Space in an artist studio. Miriam comes to the workshop to give her input on the project from the position of someone who is familiar with the space and its challenges.</p>

<p>Miriam La Rosa (Palermo, 1988) is an independent curator based in London.She holds an MA in Curating the Contemporary from London Metropolitan University and Whitechapel Gallery, London, a Master of Museology from the Reinwardt Academy, Amsterdam, and a BA (Hons) in Art History from the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Brescia. She is head of submissions for the online platform CtC and has worked in the Education, Public Programmes and Exhibitions departments of institutions such as Whitechapel Gallery, London (for the exhibition Rivane Neuenschwander, The Name of Fear), Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam (for the exhibition International ZERO Network, 1950s-60s) and Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven (for Sheela Gowda: Open Eye Policy and Piero Gilardi - Samen Werken). Recent projects include: the artistic and curatorial residency LIMITACTION (Window Space, London), collaborations with artist-run spaces BOCS, Catania, and Five Years, London, the reactive project dontdrinkthemilk and the exhibition FRAGILE (Galleria Upp, Venice)</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#4.1 Lauren Goldie]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>3 March 2016 <br>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The fourth  manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Lauren Goldie. </p>

<p>As a process based artist, Lauren is interested in the recording of the ritualistic and evolutionary nature of an artistic practice and in exploring methods of archiving and documenting the effect of light in space. Her latest body of work is influenced by her experimentations with wax, its variations and the concept of regeneration. She often deconstructs and works upon older pieces in order to create new ones. At the Window Space Lauren will revisit her work Time3 and the photography she has archived during her active installations. She will be attempting to interpret a 3-D map detailing the circulation of light and its transformation within an environment.</p>

<p>Lauren Goldie (b. 1993) is a British installation Artist based in Cambridge. She recently completed her BA in Fine Art with First class Hons, specialising in installation and printmaking at Winchester School of Art. During her studies, she developed a disciplined approach to making art with a focus on precisely executed artistic processes and thoroughly documented experiments with materials. As well as developing relationships within her local community at the Curwen Print Study Centre, Lauren has been recognised for awards such as Float Art 2015 and was rated within the top 50 Art graduates by the People of Print. As her work continues to develop, she has become increasingly interested in producing mixed media artworks that compliment her signature glass wax installations. Her work was recently featured in the RE: IMAGINED exhibition at the GX Gallery in London, where she volunteered her time as an Artist and Creative Assistant to raise funds and awareness for Parkinson's UK.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#3.1 Inês Marques - Installation Shot - Right Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/3-1-ines-marques-installation-shot-right-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1e8487f8-9d37-4b36-b721-94bdbccf7df3</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2016 14:02:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-3-1-Ines-Marques---Installation-Shot---Right-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#3.1 Inês Marques - Installation Shot - Left Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/3-1-ines-marques-installation-shot-left-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">04683ea1-28a6-4acd-95a1-c0602337972f</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2016 14:01:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-3-1-Ines-Marques---Installation-Shot---Left-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#3.1 Inês Marques - Installation Shot]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/3-1-ines-marques-installation-shot-2/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">eef95f7a-4bd9-4b55-8bd4-aa5e47ab7aca</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2016 13:58:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-3-1-Ines-Marques---Installation-Shot.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#3.1 Inês Marques]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>4 February 2016 <br>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The third manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Inês Marques. Her practice is focused on language, culture and craft and how globalisation and new media have an impact in these social aspects. Blend In is her new individual design project, which is going to have its first public debut at the Window Space. The artist assumes a critical point of view over political and economical issues worldwide, which affect how nations are seen though their economical potential. It functions as a study on how economical interests can overlap political values – ‘going to bed with the enemy’ for the sake of money – and as a critique of the homogenisation of the nations through globalisation, making these lose their traditions and authenticity. </p>

<p>Inês Marques (b. 1990, Lisbon) is a London based designer. She has completed a BA in Multimedia Arts - Installation and Performance at the Fine Arts University of Lisbon, Portugal and is currently undertaking an MA Material Futures at Central Saint Martins – University Arts of London, aimed at engaging designers to have a critical and social point of view whilst developing their projects. She was involved in the MAE’ Artist Residents in Sesimbra and worked in collaboration with FAZ – a young collective group at Arpad Szenes and Vieira da Silva Museum, Lisbon. Her work has recently been shown at PROTECHT exhibition at The Cass Bank Gallery and undertook the role of tutor/designer in Concept Catwalk, a project in collaboration with V&amp;A, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and fashion designer Nicky Vu for students of Prendergast Hilly Fields College.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot - Right Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot-right-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3c56b0e0-0de0-42cb-ae6e-6703276bbf96</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 12:08:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot---Right-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot - Left Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot-left-side/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">3bf0a00b-81f4-4541-aca0-a08f39968c16</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 12:07:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot---Left-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[#2.1 Juan Crespo - Installation Shot]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/2-1-juan-crespo-installation-shot/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">efe82446-83ab-4f7c-ac83-1e7ea6a0a05d</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 12:04:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-2-1-Juan-Crespo---Installation-Shot.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Curator with a K]]></title><description><![CDATA[2015

<p>This essay intends to explore how the role of the curator is expanding and adapting to the current new media based world, with a specific focus on web platforms. It analyses curatorial practice with and within the internet realm, ultimately posing questions related to spatial hierarchies and to the curator’s role within them.</p>

<p>Primarily, it is important to define and relate the concepts of immateriality and systems; those being the ones that define the ‘what, where and how’ of web-based art and, consequently, its curatorial challenges. There is a need to understand these new emerging ‘materialities’ as well as analysing how they work in this network system basis they inhabit. With this, there is a clearer understanding of how the role of the curator is shifting more towards a system-based collaboration, instead of the centralized model of working – the curator as a gatekeeper <strong>[1]</strong>.</p>

<p>To illustrate the ideas propositioned before, there are presented two distinct yet related examples of web influenced curatorial modes. The first is Unoriginal Genius, an exhibition curated by Domenico Quaranta at Carroll/Fletcher’s Project Space in 2014, comprising a series of web and screen based works that had a physical presence on the physical space.  It is important to stress how the curator deals with web-based works inside a gallery space and furthermore, how the institution deals with the rapidly expanding web presence, in terms of defining values and discourses. Following that, Kurator, a project developed by the programmer Grzesiek Sedek and the curator Joasia Krysa in 2004, is presented as an example of a web based software aided curating system. It depicts how art lives outside the gallery and it highlights questions of collaboration within open source networks, particularly related to curating.</p>

<p>The internet’s interface introduces exciting new opportunities and possibilities, though the concern might not be just questions of display, but to consider how both physical and web-based spaces relate and co-exist and, ultimately, how these emerging systems have influenced the practice of both artists and curators.</p>

<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The second manifestation of the project happens through the work of Juan Crespo. The artist’s web based ongoing practice focuses on aspects linked to historiographical interpretation from an interdisciplinary and new media perspective. This exhibition presents a physical form of THE DIASPORA OF THE LINE, a digital fictional archive created with files from the Imperial War Museum, British Empire and Commonwealth Museum. By using film stills and geometrical shapes Juan tends to destroy and fragment the sequential interpretation of the Colonialist process and overturn predetermined historical meanings.</p>

<p>Juan Crespo (b. 1987, Zaragoza) lives and works in London. He graduated in Fine Arts from the University of Barcelona, where he also studied the MA in Artistic Production and Research. He has recently shown works in Barcelona (Sala d’Art Jove, ARSM or Loop Video Art Festival), Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Santander, “Biennal Leandre Cristófol” La Panera, Lleida and Festival Cine-Septiembre, Sinaloa, México. He is Co-Founder of PIL Project, presented at London Metropolitan University, and now part of the Digital Artist Residency within the Wrong Biennale. PIL Project has recently been granted in Step Beyond to develop a research project in the Russia’s new internet content law.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[#1.1 Georgia Spickett-Jones - Installation Shot - Right Side]]></title><link>http://localhost:2368/vinyl-02/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">cd6e84e5-c99e-4ded-970a-a328c1bbbb06</guid><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Alice Prestes]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2015 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2016/02/-1-1-Georgia-Spickett-Jones-Installation-Shot---Right-Side.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded/></item></channel></rss>
