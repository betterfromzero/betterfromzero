				<p>Each month, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER TO START FROM ZERO presents an artist using the Window Space as a catalyst to the production and continuity of their own work. The fourth  manifestation of the project happens through the practice of Lauren Goldie. </p>

<p>As a process based artist, Lauren is interested in the recording of the ritualistic and evolutionary nature of an artistic practice and in exploring methods of archiving and documenting the effect of light in space. Her latest body of work is influenced by her experimentations with wax, its variations and the concept of regeneration. She often deconstructs and works upon older pieces in order to create new ones. At the Window Space Lauren will revisit her work Time3 and the photography she has archived during her active installations. She will be attempting to interpret a 3-D map detailing the circulation of light and its transformation within an environment.</p>

<p>Lauren Goldie (b. 1993) is a British installation Artist based in Cambridge. She recently completed her BA in Fine Art with First class Hons, specialising in installation and printmaking at Winchester School of Art. During her studies, she developed a disciplined approach to making art with a focus on precisely executed artistic processes and thoroughly documented experiments with materials. As well as developing relationships within her local community at the Curwen Print Study Centre, Lauren has been recognised for awards such as Float Art 2015 and was rated within the top 50 Art graduates by the People of Print. As her work continues to develop, she has become increasingly interested in producing mixed media artworks that compliment her signature glass wax installations. Her work was recently featured in the RE: IMAGINED exhibition at the GX Gallery in London, where she volunteered her time as an Artist and Creative Assistant to raise funds and awareness for Parkinson's UK.</p>
